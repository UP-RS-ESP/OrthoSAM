    "- `compact_fine_object_orthosam` This set of parameters is optimized for finer images and an example from the SediNet record is shown (processing takes ~2-3 minutes on a 12-core Intel with GPU. Download the image https://github.com/DigitalGrainSize/SediNet/blob/master/images/5_6.JPG and place into data/SediNet/images.\n",
    "- `large_orthosam` The second example uses a large orthomosaic _Ravi2_orthomosaic_02mm.png_. Download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16567549 and place into data/Ravi. **This will take significant time and resources**"
